This is the first in what I hope will be many posts.

Some of the reasons I want to begin blogging:

- Learn html/css
- Improve communication skills
- Document my learning and personal projects

The first thing I'll be talking about is setting up this blog: figuring out the CSS, setting up the server, etc.

I've done lots of iOS programming but this is the first time I've done even a little bit with html/css. This is my first attempt to expand my knowledge into that area.
